> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [ ] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [ ] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever spent hours playing a video game just to stare the at the absurd amount of upgrades or items you can apply to your character just to finally obtain it and realize it is __AWFUL!__ Well fear no more as with __Theory Craft__ you will no longer need to waste time any more. __Theory Craft__ will store the stats of items and skills so that you can plan out your characters build by being able to see your characters stats are without playing the game so you can waste less time testing out useless items and spend more time actually playing. Also for individuals who feel overwhelmed when it comes to building your character fear not as within __Theory Craft__ you can view other users builds and save them to be used as well.


### Design



### Key features

- Ability to save builds
- Ability to search up builds
- Seeing statline (ex current damage with gun and upgrades)
- A collection items within the game where you can see their stats

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses an HTML page to login, page to make your builds, and another page to search for other builds
- **CSS** - Style webpage in a dark color scheme that will not flash bang you at night.
- **React** - Provides login, display of your builds, display of character builder, and dispay collection of other characters builds
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
      -login
      -retrieving builds
      -uploading builds
- **DB/Login** - Store users, users saved builds, all user builds in database. Register and login users. Redentials stored in database. Can't create your own build unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As a build is uploaed this will be broadcasted for everyone to be able to view.
